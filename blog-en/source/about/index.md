Hi, welcome to visit BanbanRamble! Banban is my online handle. I like reading books, and watching dramas and documentaries. This site mainly includs my daily life, viewpoints and research essays.

The sentence "无曰已是，无曰遂真" under the site title is from the [anthem of Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/2018/0519/c19948a812253/page.htm). It means "Never say you know the essence, let alone the truth". During World War II, the University evacuated from Hangzhou to Guizhou due to the invading Imperial Japanese Army. To motivate teachers and students in distress, Prof. Ma Yifu, master of Chinese studies, wrote this University Anthem with classical Chinese.
